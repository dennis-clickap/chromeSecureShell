# chromeSecureShell

I want to use chrome secure shell on Windows and Mac, but it doesn't satisfy my usual operation habits.
So I improved it by adding more options.

# Options

* meta-as-ctrl : Map the key command+v to be ctrl+v on Mac.
* ctrl-v-paste-hacky : Force the key ctrl+v to paste content from clipboard.
